# **Seal Weight vs Days in rehabilitation: Indication of Health**
## MACS 401 Final Project 
Rachel Meade\
Winter 2023

## Research Question
Is there correlation between weight and days in rehabilitation to predict a harbor seal's survivability in a marine mammal rehabilitation setting? If correlation does exist, can we establish a working program to compare current patients weights to past patients regardles of survival?

## Goal
To create a program in which a marine mammal rehabilitator can input a seals intake weight, current weight, and number of days in rehabilitation to see if the pinniped is consistent with a healthy weight trajectory compared to previous seals. Additionally, present data of deceased seals to raise concern if the seal is following the weight trajectory of seals that ended up dying. 

## Motivation
Over this last summer I was an intern at Sea Life Response, Rehabilitation, and Research (SR3). During my time there we had a seal, Azha, who would not willingly eat nor was gaining weight. It turned out she had _____ which meant _____. If there had beemn a way to see her drastic weight difference compared to other seals that had came before her and gottem realeased (or similarity in weight of seals who had died) there may have been more alarm to further evaluate her condition and possibly find solutions or humanely euthanize her sooner. With this program, there will be less of a question of "Is this normal?" or "Is this cause for concern?" as there will be an established data set for what is "normal" weight gain for a seal in rehabilitation on the path for being healthy and released vs a seal who is not progressing and will likely not recover. 


## Data
My data comes directly from SR3. It includes the weights of 32 seals (23 of which were released, 9 which died in hospital) from May 2022 - February 2023 for a total of 517 data points. Each data point includes seal ID, date, weight (g), and intake date.
